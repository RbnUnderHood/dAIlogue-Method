# The dAIlogue Method

Created: 28.9.2025

**dAIlogue** = Daily AI Dialogue.  

This repository establishes the origin of the **dAIlogue Method**, a practice I am developing that combines:  

- **AI-assisted dialogue** with historical, philosophical, and artistic figures  
- **Philosophical inquiry** into timeless questions  
- **Personal healing and growth** through self-reflection and authentic conversation  

The method uses AI as a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern life. It is both a creative art form and a healing practice: part philosophy, part therapy, part storytelling.  

dAIlogue is not just a tool for generating content. It is a way of living in inquiry, integrating wisdom traditions, and engaging daily in conversations that cultivate truth, authenticity, and growth.  

This declaration serves to **fix authorship and timestamp** of the concept known as *The dAIlogue Method*.
